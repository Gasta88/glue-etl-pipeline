An Ideal World A simple way to understand which parts of my learning programs are actually making an impact on my people. Employees, customers or partners that retain what they learn, even months after they’ve learned it. Highly engaged learners that see the value in your learning initiatives and can pinpoint areas most beneficial for career growth. An optimized way to collect feedback on learning programs that doesn’t require hours spent building out evaluation tools and dashboards. Action plans that aim to understand how to best leverage feedback to make my learning programs even better. Sound Familiar? You want: The Challenges You may spend hours building the right tools, which is time consuming and error prone. Doing everything manually at scale isn’t realistic when you have a large number of learners with different goals or outcomes – you’re in over your head. Typical eLearning reporting focuses on quantitative data (like completion tracking), not qualitative. You have no point of reference or benchmarks. How can you tell when a course was effective enough or that the response rate was actionable? Why you aren’t living in your ideal world. * Source Today’s Solutions. Built-in survey features in an LMS. Most learning platforms offer built-in reporting capabilities (including Docebo) and blank templates for evaluations, but you don’t always have the time to build everything out as quickly as you need it. Special survey tools (not for learning). Tools like Surveymonkey aren’t built to scale for multiple learning audiences or multiple courses. You would have to spend a long time tweaking an evaluation for each course, which isn’t realistic. Keep doing what you’re doing. Leaving things as they are is always an option. But how long can you keep doing what you’re doing? And is it helping you optimize your learning program? What are my options right now? Go beyond the numbers to understand the impact of your learning programs. Measure the effectiveness of your learning programs. Improve the impact of your formal training programs and validate your company’s investment in learning with optimized out-of-the-box evaluations and dashboards. Make data-driven decisions, get answers and next steps faster by focusing on qualitative analytics, and compare your data against learning benchmarks to see how you stack up. Make data-driven decisions and demonstrate learning is a strategic investment by connecting it to knowledge retention. Prove Impact at scale Assess your learning programs thoroughly by focusing on the why, using qualitative data that goes beyond the scope of number-driven quantitative data. Drill down on what’s working Maximize learner engagement and and watch your response rates go up. As more feedback rolls in, tweak your programs based on action plans to increase learning experience effectiveness. Increase engagement Compare your data against learning benchmarks from 5+ million evaluations with clean out-of-the-box dashboards that let you immediately pinpoint areas of improvement. Leverage Benchmarks What It’s About Why Docebo Learning Impact Works Step Two Learners receive evaluations upon course completion, while Admins can start seeing results roll in via ready-to-go dashboards.
